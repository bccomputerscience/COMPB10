## Course Description
This course is designed as a first course in software engineering for mixed-majors, with an emphasis on the Computer 
Science major. Students will use the object-oriented programming language Python to learn the fundamentals of programming. 
Topics include: variables, sequence, selection, iteration, the software life-cycle, as well as common programming algorithms 
such as sorting and searching. Not open to students who have previously received credit for COMS B10.


## Student Learning Outcomes
* Describe and apply the software development life-cycle to a given problem. 
* Describe the principles of structured programming and be able to describe, design, implement, and test structured programs using currently accepted methodology and control structures. 
* Explain what an algorithm is and then be able to translate an algorithm into a programming language.

## Digital Devices (Cell phones, Personal Computer Devices, etc.)
Cell phones and cell phone usage is a classroom disruption. You know how to use and operate your devices. It is expected that you will turn cells phones off or otherwise silence your devices before class starts and respond only after class ends. If class has not started, please do not
have conversations within class on your device. Carry your conversation outside of the classroom. If there is an an emergency, you should leave the class to answer your calls or messages. Do not send text messages while in class. Again, have your conversations outside of class. This includes any
other social media platform that has messaging capabilities. Do not conduct personal conversations when the instructor is lecturing. Disciplinary action including removal from class will result. Personal computers or other electronic devices should not be used in class for non-class related activities. In classes with Labs or other areas where computers are being used, these systems are provided for classroom activities only. 

## Attendance
Attendance is mandatory. The attendance policy as outlined in the campus catalog will be enforced. Students must notify me in the event of class absences.  Any student that is absent for more than two weeks without prior instructor notification may be dropped from the course. If you do not want to be in the class then you must drop yourself from the course.  I will not retroactively drop you if you miss one of the “last day” to drop the course dates.  These dates are listed in the colleges academic calendar under [Important Dates](https://www.bakersfieldcollege.edu/important-dates). It is also expected that students will notify me before class in the rare instance of needing to leave class early.  Students, not notifying me in advance, may be marked absent upon their early departure.

## Technology Requirements
### Access
If you do not have access to a computer off campus, there are several computer labs on campus you can use to participate in the course.

### Announcements
Announcements will be posted in Canvas on a regular basis. They will appear on your Canvas dashboard when you log in and/or will be sent to you directly through your preferred method of notification from Canvas. Please make certain to check them regularly, as they will contain any important information
about upcoming projects or class concerns. 

### Email
In this course we will use the Conversations feature to send private email  messages to me. You access the Conversations feature through your Inbox located in the Navigation Pane on the left side of the Canvas portal. You can either check your messages in the
Canvas system or set your notifications to your preferred method of contact. Please check your
messages regularly. When submitting messages, please do the following:
* Put a subject in the subject box that describes the email content For example: Canvas Scavenger Hunt or Programming Assignment 1.
* Send email only through Conversations in Canvas and not to my school email account.
* Do not send messages asking general information about the class, please post those in the
Discussions area in our Canvas Course.
* Do not submit your assignments by message. They will not be accepted.
* Make certain to check your messages frequently.

### Course Questions
In all courses it is normal to have many questions about things that relate to the course, such as
clarification about assignments, course materials, or assessments. Please post these in the Discussions
area which you can access by clicking the Discussions button in the course navigation links. This is
an open forum, and you are encouraged to give answers and help each other. [Canvas Student Guide](http://guides.instructure.com/s/2204/m/4212)

### Discussion Forums
Discussion Forums are a way for you to engage with each other about the course content. Each lesson
module will have a question that links to a forum. You can also access each forum by clicking on the
Discussions button in the course navigation links. In order to get full credit for each discussion, you will
need to post a thoughtful, well-written response to the question and respond to two of your classmates’
answers.[ Canvas Student Guide](http://guides.instructure.com/s/2204/m/4212)


## General Classroom Etiquette
The intent of the classroom etiquette policy is to outline the need to have considerations for other students within your class. The following guidelines
have been provided to help you understand what this means.

* Digital devices should be silenced, turned off, or otherwise muted. 
* Prepare your desktop/tabletop area before the lecture starts. Prepare to leave once the lecture is concluded. Not before.
  * If you're in a computer lab, get logged in promptly. 
* No eating in the classroom.
  * If you're in a computer lab, do not bring in outside beverages.
* Sleeping is now allowed. If you are tired, please rest outside of the classroom. If you'd like, you can stand up in the back of the class.
  * If you are asleep you will be asked to leave.
