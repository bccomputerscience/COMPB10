## Course Description
This course is designed as a first course in software engineering for mixed-majors, with an emphasis on the Computer 
Science major. Students will use the object-oriented programming language Python to learn the fundamentals of programming. 
Topics include: variables, sequence, selection, iteration, the software life-cycle, as well as common programming algorithms 
such as sorting and searching. Not open to students who have previously received credit for COMS B10.

## Student Learning Outcomes
* Describe and apply the software development life-cycle to a given problem. 
* Describe the principles of structured programming and be able to describe, design, implement, and test structured programs using currently accepted methodology and control structures. 
* Explain what an algorithm is and then be able to translate an algorithm into a programming language.

## Accommodations 
Students with disabilities needing accommodation, including those who had an IEP in high school, should make requests to Disabled Students Programs and Services in CSS 10, or Delano room 1001 (661-395-4334, (661-720-2000 Delano)).  All requests for accommodations require appropriate advance notice to avoid a delay in services. Please discuss approved accommodations with me so we can work together to ensure your access and success at BC

## Attendance
Attendance is mandatory. The attendance policy as outlined in the campus catalog will be enforced. Students must notify me in the event of class absences.  Any student that is absent for more than two weeks without prior instructor notification may be dropped from the course. If you do not want to be in the class then you must drop yourself from the course.  I will not retroactively drop you if you miss one of the “last day” to drop the course dates.  These dates are listed in class schedule and in the online campus schedule “Important Dates” section. It is also expected that students will notify me before class in the rare instance of needing to leave class early.  Students, not notifying me in advance, will be marked absent upon their early departure.
